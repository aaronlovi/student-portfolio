### Bootstrap 4 Project

An example project using Bootstrap 4 to demonstrate layout and other Bootstrap effects.

### HTML Examples

Some HTML examples that were written while taking the CSS and Bootstrap course

### Pizza Menu

This project is a menu to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the
input information and calculates a price for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first
and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants
to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

### Calculator

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version
of a calculator.
